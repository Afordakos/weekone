Hello World

Welcome to my site!

<!-- image of a duck -->

I am currently learning to code over four weeks, in the first ever Barclays coding series.
We are going to learn how to build websites using HMTL, CSS and JS. 
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...

HTML is great
CSS is better
JS is the best

What do you need to create a website?

Not much!
A computer (always a good start)
A text editor (I am using atom)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS files

Follow my progress on github
