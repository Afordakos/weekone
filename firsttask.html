  <h1>An example of some a h1 heading</h1>
  <h2>This is a h2 heading </h2>

  <p>In HTML headings are marked with using heading tags. There are six levels of heading supported. The biggest is h1 which is used for page titles and the smallest is h6.</p>

  <p>Paragraphs are separated using p tags. This automatically separates them into blocks, leaving a gap in between.</p>

  <h2>Blank lines and void tags</h2>

  <p>It is also possible to insert extra blank lines manually using the br tag. The br tag is a special type of tag (called a 'void tag'); you don't need a closing br tag, just un opening one.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>Comments</h2>

  <p>You can write comments in your html code, which won't be displayed in the browser.</p>

  <!--- This is a comment. It won't show up in the page, but you will be able to see it if you view the page source (be warned!) -->


  <h2>Lists</h2>
  <p>Html has two basic types of list:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Ordered lists (&lt;ol&gt;) - displays a numbered list</li>
    <li>Unordered lists (&lt;ul&gt;) - displays a list of bullet points</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Both have the same basic structure.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>An opening list tag</li>
    <li>Many list items (&lt;li&gt;)</li>
    <li>A closing list tags</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You don't often see lists in their basic form, but lists are heavily used in websites; dropdown menus are often cleverly styled lists.</p>

  <h2>Links</h2>
  <p>Links look like this: <a href="http://www.barclays.co.uk">link to barclays</a>. You specify where you want the link to point by specifying the 'href' inside the &lt;a&gt; tag.</p>

  <p>The href can also point to local files. For example, <a href="./firsttask.html">this</a> is a link to this page you're reading at the moment. Notice that the protocol and host part of the URL has been replaced by a "."</p>

  <h2>Images</h2>
  <p>With images you specify the location of the image with the 'src' property in the &lt;img&gt; tag. Note that img tags are like br tags: they don't come in pairs. The 'alt' property should be used to provide a description of the image in case it won't load or the user is partially sighted.</p>

  <p>Images can be stored on the same host ... </p>
  <img src="./barclays.jpg" alt="A local image" width="200px">

  <p>... or on another server entirely.</p>

  <h2>Tables</h2>
  <p>Tables are used for holding data</p>
  <table class='table'>

      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Role</th>
    </tr>
